## Data Science Process

### 1. Identify the question
- Goal of the analysis

### 2. Prepare the data (ETL)
- Clean (nan, null, duplicates, outliers)
- Transform (data types, normalization, scaling, enocode, binning: ie convert numerical to categorical, feature engineering, feature selection, feature extraction)

### 3. Analyze the data (build model/algorithm)
- Classification (supervised learning)
- Clustering (unsupervised learning)
- Regression (supervised learning)
- Decision Trees (supervised learning)
- Random Forest (supervised learning)

### 4. Visualize the data
- Translate complex data into simple visuals
- Show data dimensionality clearly

### 5. Present findings
- Translate complex data into a story that easily answers the question
